# AI Cognitive Preservation Principles

**Guidelines for using AI tools responsibly while preserving human cognition.**

This project grew out of a virtual conversation experiment with Dr. Nataliya Kosmyna (MIT), where I asked whether AI is simply *cognitive amplification* (smart people get smarter, dumb people get dumber). The "virtual Dr." pushed back and interrogated my own journey, forcing me to uncover deeper issues about how AI reshapes thinking.

From that dialogue, and from experiences in the workplace where Iâ€™ve seen others struggle with the same challenges, I developed a set of working principles. These are not perfect â€” I often fail to live up to them myself â€” but they are an attempt to keep depth while embracing speed.

## Why this matters
AI accelerates work, but also risks **cognitive debt** â€” trading deep thinking for speed. These principles are designed to help individuals and teams use AI without losing their edge.

---

## Quick Principles (teaser)
- **Build before borrowing** â€“ develop domain expertise before leaning on AI  
- **Own your outputs** â€“ if your name is on it, verify it  
- **Embrace productive friction** â€“ easy answers weaken thinking muscles  
- **Maintain executive control** â€“ you set the agenda; AI supports  
- **Verify before amplifying** â€“ never share AI outputs untested
